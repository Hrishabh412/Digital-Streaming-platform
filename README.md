# Digital-Streaming-platform


My project is about predicting the viewership of any Digital Streaming Platform and reason behind the decrement  in  viewership.  
In this project I’ve used Multiple linear regression for prediction and the multiple regression analysis is used where the number of independent variables are more then one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(Reason of decrement) and dependent(viewership) variable.
So, user will choose attributes from given dataset and the project will calculate the parameters (by which user will decide  the reason of downfall in viewership) and plot graphs, ralationship. So he/she can remove useless attributes and instead of them use other. So it will help him/her to increase the viewership.
I have used python and it’s libraries in the backend.
